 This File contains the TraderInfoWindow which is a GUI element, most likely a 
 dialog window, which will show the contents of the TraderInventory class, along 
 with an estimate of how much fuel it will take to arrive by BurnAndFlip from 
 the Maneuvers class, the option to initiate the burnAndFlip, and how much it will
 cost to replace the fuel spent once you arrive.
