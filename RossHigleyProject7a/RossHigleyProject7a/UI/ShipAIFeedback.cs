 This file contains the Ship's Artificial Intelligence Feeback GUI display, 
 which appears as a textblock on the bottom of the window. It can be used by any 
 class to show messages to the user, and even to queue messages to show soon, but
 not immediately. Messages will be removed from the queue when they are displayed.
