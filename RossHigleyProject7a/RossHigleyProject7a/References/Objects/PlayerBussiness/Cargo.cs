/* 
 Ross Higley    11/16/16
 This file contains the Cargo class, which is the list of inventory inside the player's ship. 
 Each Item has a quantity, stores in units of grams. Also has methods to convert these lists 
 into formatted strings for displaying. 
 
 Most modifying of these lists will actually be done by the TraderInventory class, which will 
 access this object through a PlayerShip object (make sure PlayerShip contains a reference to 
 here)
